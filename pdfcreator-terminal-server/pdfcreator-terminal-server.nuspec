    <description> # PDFCreator Terminal Server
Attention! This package installs software that requires a license.

## Features
- With **PDFCreator Terminal Server** you get all the features that are included in PDFCreator Professional.
- You have the freedom to use this solution for an unlimited number of users. The license fee is paid per server, not per user
- Load balancing will not cause any issues for the license as it is deployed to the machine. Hence users can float between servers without problems
- A big strength of PDFCreator Terminal Server is the user session isolation. Print data will not move from one session to another, even if the same user is logged in multiple times.
- Allows the central management of settings via group policies. The deployment can be done with our regular installer or by deploying the MSI through group policies.
- Like all PDFCreator Business solutions, this edition includes priority support by e-mail.
